This is based on a real world project with real world impact. Due to the nature of it, some areas of the model have been changed and all numbers shown fake.

I created this based off of a need to visualize a large dataset for my organization that previously relied on slide decks using PowerPoint. It was my first time interacting with Tableau and I taught myself how to use the software while building this. 


Below are some screen shots of the project. I made this to be vary dynamic and it can be filtered any way the user desires.
